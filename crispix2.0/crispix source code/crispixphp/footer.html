                Crispix is not affiliated with www.crispix.com, home of Kellogg's Crispix cereal. However, if you are
                hungry for cereal, you can't beat delicious Crispix cereal,<br /> with it's crispy rice on the one side and crunchy corn
                on the other. This is not a paid endorsement, just my small way of saying "Please don't sue me, Kelloggs".
